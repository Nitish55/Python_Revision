       "  'body': '- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the latest version of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] (optional) I have confirmed this bug exists on the master branch of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n**Note**: Please read [this guide](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports) detailing how to provide the necessary information for us to reproduce your bug.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nclass LoggingStringArray(pd.arrays.StringArray):\\r\\n    \"\"\"Extend StringArray to log arguments to __getitem__\"\"\"\\r\\n    def __getitem__(self, item):\\r\\n        print(f\"Argument to __getitem__ is \\'{item}\\'\")\\r\\n        return super().__getitem__(item)\\r\\n\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"col1\": LoggingStringArray(np.array([\"hello\", \"world\"], dtype=object))})\\r\\n_ = df.iloc[:1]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nExpected output:\\r\\n```\\r\\nArgument to __getitem__ is \\'slice(None, 1, None)\\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nActual output:\\r\\n```\\r\\nArgument to __getitem__ is \\'(Ellipsis, slice(None, 1, None))\\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Problem description\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a DataFrame contains extension types, the block manager turns a 1D slice in the form `DataFrame.iloc[slice(x, y, z)]` into an N-dimensional slice over the ExtensionArray of the form `__getitem__((Ellipsis, slice(x, y, z))` . This problem breaks the `__getitem__()` method on one of our extension types in [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://github.com/CODAIT/text-extensions-for-pandas).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `__getitem__` methods in Pandas\\' built-in extension types happens to work when fed this kind of n-dimensional slice\\r\\n--- they just ignore the `Ellipsis` in the first position of the tuple. But I don\\'t think they\\'re supposed to accept that type of input.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe root cause is the new method `Block.getitem_block_index()`, added during some performance optimizations introduced in pandas-dev/pandas#40353:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n    def getitem_block_index(self, slicer: slice) -> Block:\\r\\n        \"\"\"\\r\\n        Perform __getitem__-like specialized to slicing along index.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Assumes self.ndim == 2\\r\\n        \"\"\"\\r\\n        # error: Invalid index type \"Tuple[ellipsis, slice]\" for\\r\\n        # \"Union[ndarray, ExtensionArray]\"; expected type \"Union[int, slice, ndarray]\"\\r\\n        new_values = self.values[..., slicer]  # type: ignore[index]\\r\\n        return type(self)(new_values, self._mgr_locs, ndim=self.ndim)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis method assumes that the contents of the block are 2-dimensional. The `ExtensionBlock` class inherits this method from `EABackedBlock`, which inherits it from `Block`.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Output of ``pd.show_versions()``\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit           : f00ed8f47020034e752baf0250483053340971b0\\r\\npython           : 3.7.10.final.0\\r\\npython-bits      : 64\\r\\nOS               : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release       : 20.5.0\\r\\nVersion          : Darwin Kernel Version 20.5.0: Sat May  8 05:10:33 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.121.3~9/RELEASE_X86_64\\r\\nmachine          : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor        : i386\\r\\nbyteorder        : little\\r\\nLC_ALL           : None\\r\\nLANG             : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas           : 1.3.0\\r\\nnumpy            : 1.21.0\\r\\npytz             : 2021.1\\r\\ndateutil         : 2.8.1\\r\\npip              : 21.1.3\\r\\nsetuptools       : 52.0.0.post20210125\\r\\nCython           : None\\r\\npytest           : 6.2.4\\r\\nhypothesis       : None\\r\\nsphinx           : 4.0.2\\r\\nblosc            : None\\r\\nfeather          : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter       : None\\r\\nlxml.etree       : None\\r\\nhtml5lib         : None\\r\\npymysql          : None\\r\\npsycopg2         : None\\r\\njinja2           : 3.0.1\\r\\nIPython          : 7.25.0\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4              : None\\r\\nbottleneck       : None\\r\\nfsspec           : None\\r\\nfastparquet      : None\\r\\ngcsfs            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib       : 3.4.2\\r\\nnumexpr          : None\\r\\nodfpy            : None\\r\\nopenpyxl         : None\\r\\npandas_gbq       : None\\r\\npyarrow          : 4.0.1\\r\\npyxlsb           : None\\r\\ns3fs             : None\\r\\nscipy            : 1.7.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy       : None\\r\\ntables           : None\\r\\ntabulate         : None\\r\\nxarray           : None\\r\\nxlrd             : None\\r\\nxlwt             : None\\r\\nnumba            : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'body': 'Hi, \\r\\n\\r\\nVery often when manipulating pandas DataFrames I had a SettingWithCopyWarning and I did not understand why because the warning message was telling me to use the syntax .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value , which I was already using !\\r\\nThe issue actually had nothing to do with the .loc syntax but with the fact that the dataframe I was trying to modify was created by applying a filter on another dataframe (something like : df1 = df0[df0.column_x == value_x]), therefore there was an ambiguity on whether the original dataframe should be modified or not. In my case I did not want to modify df0 so the clean way of creating df1 was df1 = df0[df0.column_x == value_x].copy(), which solved the issue and I did not get the warning anymore.\\r\\nI think this a very common issue, this is why, in my opinion, it could be a nice idea to include in the warning message that if the issue is not coming from the .loc syntax, it is likely that it comes from the fact that the concerned dataframe is probably a filtered copy of another dataframe and that adding .copy() when defining this particular dataframe might solve the issue. \\r\\nI hope my message was clear enough, otherwise I can try to explain it better if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave a good day, \\r\\n\\r\\nWallerand',\n",

Since I\\'m computing a value per row, I expect the same number of rows in the output as in the input. It\\'s especially weird that this only happens if the columns are categorical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\": list(\"abcde\"), \"b\": list(\"abcde\")}, index=list(\"aabbc\"))\\r\\ndf.agg(\"-\".join, axis=1)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\na    a-a\\r\\na    b-b\\r\\nb    c-c\\r\\nb    d-d\\r\\nc    e-e\\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nin both versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Expected Output\\r\\n\\r\\nI would expect the same output between versions. The result given by 1.2.5 seems more correct to me at the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Output of ``pd.show_versions()``\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit           : f00ed8f47020034e752baf0250483053340971b0\\r\\npython           : 3.8.10.final.0\\r\\npython-bits      : 64\\r\\nOS               : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release       : 20.5.0\\r\\nVersion          : Darwin Kernel Version 20.5.0: Sat May  8 05:10:33 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.121.3~9/RELEASE_X86_64\\r\\nmachine          : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor        : i386\\r\\nbyteorder        : little\\r\\nLC_ALL           : None\\r\\nLANG             : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas           : 1.3.0\\r\\nnumpy            : 1.21.0\\r\\npytz             : 2020.1\\r\\ndateutil         : 2.8.1\\r\\npip              : 21.1.3\\r\\nsetuptools       : 56.0.0\\r\\nCython           : 0.29.23\\r\\npytest           : 6.2.4\\r\\nhypothesis       : None\\r\\nsphinx           : 4.0.2\\r\\nblosc            : None\\r\\nfeather          : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter       : None\\r\\nlxml.etree       : 4.6.3\\r\\nhtml5lib         : None\\r\\npymysql          : None\\r\\npsycopg2         : None\\r\\njinja2           : 2.11.2\\r\\nIPython          : 7.23.1\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4              : 4.9.3\\r\\nbottleneck       : None\\r\\nfsspec           : 2021.06.0\\r\\nfastparquet      : 0.4.1\\r\\ngcsfs            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib       : 3.4.2\\r\\nnumexpr          : 2.7.2\\r\\nodfpy            : None\\r\\nopenpyxl         : None\\r\\npandas_gbq       : None\\r\\npyarrow          : 4.0.1\\r\\npyxlsb           : None\\r\\ns3fs             : 0.4.2\\r\\nscipy            : 1.7.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy       : 1.3.18\\r\\ntables           : 3.6.1\\r\\ntabulate         : 0.8.7\\r\\nxarray           : 0.18.2\\r\\nxlrd             : 1.2.0\\r\\nxlwt             : None\\r\\nnumba            : 0.53.1\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

This used to be handled by pandas, but now isn\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a problem because it\\'s a behaviour change that breaks existing code. As far as I can tell from the release notes, this was not an intentional behaviour change. It does look like some things around column assignment did change, and I imagine that assigning with deprecated numpy types was not considered.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Expected Output\\r\\n\\r\\nI would expect this to not error, and for this to pass: `np.testing.assert_array_equal(df[\"X_sum\"], np.ravel(X.sum(axis=1)))`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Output of ``pd.show_versions()``\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit           : f00ed8f47020034e752baf0250483053340971b0\\r\\npython           : 3.8.10.final.0\\r\\npython-bits      : 64\\r\\nOS               : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release       : 20.5.0\\r\\nVersion          : Darwin Kernel Version 20.5.0: Sat May  8 05:10:33 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.121.3~9/RELEASE_X86_64\\r\\nmachine          : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor        : i386\\r\\nbyteorder        : little\\r\\nLC_ALL           : None\\r\\nLANG             : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas           : 1.3.0\\r\\nnumpy            : 1.21.0\\r\\npytz             : 2020.1\\r\\ndateutil         : 2.8.1\\r\\npip              : 21.1.3\\r\\nsetuptools       : 56.0.0\\r\\nCython           : 0.29.23\\r\\npytest           : 6.2.4\\r\\nhypothesis       : None\\r\\nsphinx           : 4.0.2\\r\\nblosc            : None\\r\\nfeather          : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter       : None\\r\\nlxml.etree       : 4.6.3\\r\\nhtml5lib         : None\\r\\npymysql          : None\\r\\npsycopg2         : None\\r\\njinja2           : 2.11.2\\r\\nIPython          : 7.23.1\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4              : 4.9.3\\r\\nbottleneck       : None\\r\\nfsspec           : 2021.06.0\\r\\nfastparquet      : 0.4.1\\r\\ngcsfs            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib       : 3.4.2\\r\\nnumexpr          : 2.7.2\\r\\nodfpy            : None\\r\\nopenpyxl         : None\\r\\npandas_gbq       : None\\r\\npyarrow          : 4.0.1\\r\\npyxlsb           : None\\r\\ns3fs             : 0.4.2\\r\\nscipy            : 1.7.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy       : 1.3.18\\r\\ntables           : 3.6.1\\r\\ntabulate         : 0.8.7\\r\\nxarray           : 0.18.2\\r\\nxlrd             : 1.2.0\\r\\nxlwt             : None\\r\\nnumba            : 0.53.1\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
